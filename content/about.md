# Hello!

I am a software developer. I hope to collect and refine here many thoughts, and hopefully someone else will find them useful.

My professional interests are distributed systems and functional programming.

My personal interests are chess, video games, and reading.

I don't have any social media, but my email and github are available on my site's landing page and footer.

Though it should go without saying, any and every opinion or idea expressed on this site is completely unrelated to my employer unless explicitly mentioned as such.
